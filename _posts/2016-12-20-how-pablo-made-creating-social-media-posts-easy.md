Are you designing image posts for social media? Well, then there is 
great news as you read on.

Social media experts stress the significance of images to gain impressions/views.Â 
<br>However, creating an image post is quite cumbersome in Photoshop. Frankly, it just takes too much time.

<!--excerpt-->

One day I discovered [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva"){:target="_blank"}. Creating image posts became simple. Layering, filters, cropping, etc. along
with predefined templates; What more can you ask?
    
Life was good, till I met Pablo. BAM! Simple became easy.

The above image post was made using Pablo.

1. <b>Selecting canvas size</b>: You can pick a canvas for Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook or Twitter. Each platform has its dimension rules for images; Pablo takes this into consideration.
1. <b>Selecting a background</b>: I normally select free stock Photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/ "Unsplash"){:target="_blank"}; High resolution 
photos that are free to use. Pablo uses Unsplash by default for inserting background images. 
1. <b>Writing the text</b>: The text section is divided into a header, body, and caption. 
It also generates random inspirational quotes for you.
1. <b>Setting your logo</b>: Upload your logo once and forget about it. You have the option to hide it, change the size and add the radius to make it rounded. 
1. <b>Sharing the post</b>: One click share to 
Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram; You can also download or buffer the post.

    <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/gallery/pablo2.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/gallery/pablo2.png"></a>
</figure>

Even writing the text can be eliminated by using 
the [Pablo extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pablo/gfpibnlcombjoeejlongmihndgkpnjjo "Pablo extension for Chrome"){:target="_blank"} . 

>&quot;Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.&quot;
