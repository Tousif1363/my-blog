We have all heard social media experts emphasizing the importance of images 
to gain impressions/views in social media.Â 
<br>However, creating an image post is quite cumbersome in Photoshop. Frankly, it just takes too much time.

<!--excerpt-->

One day I discovered [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva"){:target="_blank"}. Creating image posts became simple. Layering, filters, cropping etc. along
with predefined templates; What more can you ask for?
    
Life was good, till I met Pablo. BAM! Simple became easy.

The above image post was made using Pablo.

1. <b>Selecting canvas size</b>: You can select a canvas for Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook or 
Twitter. Each platform has its own dimension rules for images; This is taken care by Pablo.
1. <b>Selecting a background</b>: I normally select free stock Photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/ "Unsplash"){:target="_blank"} ; High resolution 
photos that are free to use. Pablo uses Unsplash by default to set background images. 
1. <b>Writing the text</b>: The text section is divided into header, body and caption. 
It also generates random inspirational quotes for you.
1. <b>Setting your logo</b>: Upload your logo once and forget about it. You have the option to 
hide it , change the size and add radius to make it rounded. 
1. <b>Sharing the post</b>: 1.	One click share to 
Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram; You can also download or buffer the post.

Even writing the text can be eliminated by using 
the [Pablo extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pablo/gfpibnlcombjoeejlongmihndgkpnjjo "Pablo extension for Chrome"){:target="_blank"} . 

Still can't believe it's that simple. Give it a try : [Pablo](https://pablo.buffer.com/ "Pablo"){:target="_blank"} . <br>I bet you won't regret it.

 

>&quot;Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.&quot;
