Twitter is simply amazing at delivering the news around the world, sometimes even better than the media.

However as the list of the number of people you follow increases, your feed is cluttered with a lot of noise.
And finding the relevant news for the day can be a big challenege.

Hash solves this problem by delivering the most important news of that day along with the top tweets 
talking about those stories.

You might be thinking "Alright, so it good at organizing news." 
<br>It is pretty good at that. But wait there is more :
  * You don't have to login to read the news.
  * It has a beautifully designed interface, that makes reading the news uber fun.
  * Every story inlcludes a brief from Wiki , to give you a quick overview and as you scroll down
  you can read the tweets related to that hashtag.
  * Apart from the big stories, you can also read news about different categories like Music, Technology, 
  Talk Shows, Finance, Sports, Travel, Photography, Fashion.
  * You can subscribe to get daily round of the news in your mailbox.
